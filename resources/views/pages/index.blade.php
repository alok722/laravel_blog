I made this website while learning Laravel(PHP Framework). This website is fully responsive. I have shared all my projects along with the codes under the Blog section. You are free to use any of my codes and work. If you want to share any of your projects, you can do that by simply logging in the website and creating a Blog Post. Very soon I will also add the feature for discussion. If someone out there want to collaborate with me on this project can connect with me. I will be more than happy to collaborate.
